From time to time react or node seem to get hosed and the react app won't start because 
of some error.  I fix it typically by reinstalling npm and the dependencies
with

npm install -g npm@latest to update npm because it is sometimes buggy.
rm -rf node_modules to remove the existing modules.
npm install to re-install the project dependencies.


----
Sometimes above doesn't work and it may be an issue with the file watchers limit being exceeded.
VS Code saves and react are interrelated.

To see limit:
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

You can set a new limit temporary with:

$ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
$ sudo sysctl -p
If you like to make your limit permanent, use:

$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ sudo sysctl -p

11/4/19 - I made mine permanent 
11/4/19 - upgraded node to version 12.13

Stopped using VS Code because is a memory hog with running react.  Switched to emacs with
rjsx mode 


Fresh setup on a machine:
1.  clone pairup to dir (e.g. pairup/ui)
2.  clone partner to a dir (e.g. pairup/partner)
3.  Create venv in partner and install dependencies in requirements.txt
4.  Create Flask runtime configuration pointing to script pairup/partner/partner.py
5.  Install npm dependencies for pairup (run npm audit fix to get rid of warnings)
6.  Edit partner/config.cfg and set paths correctly
7.  source venv/bin/activate
8.  cd partner
9.  flask db init
10. flask db migrate
11. npm start
