From time to time react or node seem to get hosed and the react app won't start because 
of some error.  I fix it typically by reinstalling npm and the dependencies
with

npm install -g npm@latest to update npm because it is sometimes buggy.
rm -rf node_modules to remove the existing modules.
npm install to re-install the project dependencies.
