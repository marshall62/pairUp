How to run this:
cd to root dir
npm start
This uses the start target within package.json

When running the localhost this start target should be:
"start": "react-scripts start",
But when on the heroku server it should be:
"start": "node server.js",

Since there aren't valid comment chars in JSON I have both start targets in package.json and set them accordingly.
I'm also not allowed to make up my own targets like "local-start" so I'm not sure how to deal with these two different starts
in two diff environments.  Not sure why running server.js locally fails but that seems to be what needs to work.

So this is clearly a problem because when I deploy to heroku it leaves the project in a state where it will no longer run
locally.

----------------------------

From time to time react or node seem to get hosed and the react app won't start because
of some error.  I fix it typically by reinstalling npm and the dependencies
with

npm install -g npm@latest to update npm because it is sometimes buggy.
rm -rf node_modules to remove the existing modules.
npm install to re-install the project dependencies.


----
Sometimes above doesn't work and it may be an issue with the file watchers limit being exceeded.
VS Code saves and react are interrelated.

To see limit:
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

You can set a new limit temporary with:

$ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
$ sudo sysctl -p
If you like to make your limit permanent, use:

$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
$ sudo sysctl -p

Stopped using VS Code because is a memory hog with running react.  Switched to emacs with
rjsx mode 


Fresh setup on a machine:
1.  clone pairup to dir (e.g. pairup/ui)
2.  clone partner to a dir (e.g. pairup/partner)
3.  Create venv in partner and install dependencies in requirements.txt
4.  Create Flask runtime configuration pointing to script pairup/partner/partner.py
5.  Install npm dependencies for pairup (run npm audit fix to get rid of warnings)
    npm install
7.  source venv/bin/activate
8.  cd partner
9.  flask db init
10. flask db migrate
11. npm start
